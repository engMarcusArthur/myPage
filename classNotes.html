        Title: What is the goal?
        Primary Actor: Who desires it?
        Success Scenario: How is it accomplished?

    <h4>
        A first sprint

    <p>
        Title: Collect and store data from a equipment <br>
        Primary Actor: Maintenance Planner (MP) <br>
        Success Scenario: <br>
        [functional requirements]: MP insert the data of equipaments including for each its description (ex.: engine, generator, mixer, pump etc.), its functional location, brand, serial number and manufacturing date, technical characteristics, manufacturer specification code, installation and start date. This insertion must to be in a form where the fields (except date fields) must to have available to fill and the data must to compose various catalogs. The date fields must to present a calendar to help to fill it. The catalogs must to be available to selection by the MP thus he or she can choose from a list or if the description is not already in the list it can be inserted directly and saved to enrich the catalogs. As equipments would have more than one technical characteristics, so the application must to provide the number of fields to insert phisical characteristics as well as a fields for physical quantities (e.g. m, cm, kg, N, kgf, pounds, m³ etc.). This physical quantities fields must to be linked to a catalog that must to be provided previously by the application. Except the description and functional location, none of the fields must to be of mandatory fulfillment. The MP must to have access to alter each recording untill a manager decide differently. MP and manager will access the application via username and password. <br>
        [non-functional requirements]: The system must to run at a Windows 10 or superior and available at the browser Chrome in its last stable version.

Include use case diagram. Each use case surrounded by ellypsis and all of them inside a box. The actors come at the side and with lines connecting each one to the use cases which are related. The use of arrows or to insert index numbers is not appropriate because it is not important at this stage of definition.

Put the scenario in ordered list and discretize the tasks.
